# Rough Pitch 

This project Dubbed water-clock: 
is a react-frontend application in the brainstorming phase. 

### A social media application 
Inspired by the countdown timer in Union Square in Manhattan which represents the countdown to the end of the world apparently? 
But instead of counting down *that* specifically, this will be timer to raise people's awareness on global and environemental issues. 

Also there may be more than one clock/timer 
For Example: 
One timer could be for counting the number of countries or populations (# of people) who don't have access to fresh water or are affected by lack of fresh water

Users upon opening the site or logging in will see a clock or counter, with a short description beneath it. 
The numbers will either go up or down if a counter, if it's a clock there may be some significane behind the time displayed. 

## Tools and Technologies: 
Timers, Timezones, javascript time methods 
Databases?, Authentication? 

# User Stories:
- When I a user first comes to the home page
  - They see a timer
  - They can see multiple timers (1 big, a couple smaller ones surrounding it)
  - Annoymous commenting, live stream commenting
  - We want th clocks to be interactive (so they can understand what the issue is) (provide more info)
    - either clickable, tooltip, or modal
